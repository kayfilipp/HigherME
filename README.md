# HigherME
A repository for the University of San Diego's HigherME Capstone project. This project seeks to provide insight on the mismatch between the supply and demand of nontraditional STEM hires and how companies can be better equipped to identify diverse talent that traditional recruiting cycles tend to overlook.

#### Implementation
This element of the HigherME Pipeline utilizes VBScript in tandem with the selenium webdriver to scrape linkedIn search pages for contacts based on search terms generated by our team. **This implementation only works on Windows / PC and will not work on Mac or other operating systems.**

#### Steps
1. Download the SeleniumBasic installation <a href='https://florentbr.github.io/SeleniumBasic/'>here</a>.
2. Download the appropriate chromedriver and version of chrome <a href='https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads'>here</a>. This will depend entirely on what version of chrome you have available. For example, Chrome version 103 requires ChromeDriver 103, etc.
3. After downloading your chromedriver, place it in ```C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\SeleniumBasic``` . Placing your driver anywhere else will cause it to get ignored by the Selenium Library during runtime.
4. In command prompt (cmd), execute the scraping module by typing ```cscript "full\path\here\vba_scrape.vbs"``` . Using cscript ensures that all print statements will be generated in the command-line and not through pop-up boxes, which is a default for vbs.
